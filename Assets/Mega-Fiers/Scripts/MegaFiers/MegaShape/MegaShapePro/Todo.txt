Todos from code:

BUG: Wont rebuild unless paths are set in Lofter
BUG: crossrot = 0 we get assertion in some Sphere.cpp file

IDEA: Games can be made in a 2D way on a hidden level and then mapped to loft, so can have action happening around a loft

TODO: Option for creating a mesh object per layer
TODO: Double sided
TODO: Spline code to return normal at point and or velocity
TODO: make sure start and ends are correct
TODO: Start and end should be in section so can stop and start bits, could do with new loft
TODO: split into multiple objects so can be culled
TODO: calc own normals
TODO: Random scatter of objects, start, end, width and curve, offset and curve
TODO: Curve for vert spacing across and along
TODO: Loft a mesh with a deform to cross section and path
TODO: Need to get auto sub object builder working so we have no issues with vertex counts
TODO: Parent lofts or target lofts need to be from scene
TODO: Per object rot addition
TODO: range for random spacing
TODO: array for mains to vary weights for each
TODO: noise to verts
TODO: other objects to use in line
TODO: distribute by random and weight or set repeats
TODO: Use gameobject instead of mesh for clone/scatter objects so can set multi mats correctly
TODO: Make all work with multiple materials
TODO: Have limit on verts before new mesh built
TODO: distance for crossverts so can do better positioning
TODO: multiple clone and scatter objects with weights, also noise values for rot and scale
TODO: rules for clone, ie 1 of this follwed by 4 of this etc
TODO: mirror for clone
TODO: As well as snap to top bottom have clip to top bottom to flatten off
TODO: Get this working with Layers building their own data
TODO: Color values to transition textures
TODO: 2nd uv coords
TODO: Optimize interp to provide tangent and or normal at same time
TODO: Mesh builders should be multithreaded if possible, should be easy for most
TODO: Add a line shape with length and number of points
TODO: curves for scales, general offset, bank etc
TODO: Auto banking on turn
TODO: Auto length dist based on curve, add same for cross section
TODO: Scale option so will attempt to scale main object to exactly fit curve
TODO: Change all start and ends to start and length
TODO: Spacing between start and ends and mid objs
TODO: Loft a mesh with a deform to cross section and path
TODO: Need to get auto sub object builder working so we have no issues with vertex counts
TODO: Parent lofts or target lofts need to be from scene
TODO: Per object rot addition
TODO: range for random spacing
TODO: array for mains to vary weights for each
TODO: noise to verts
TODO: other objects to use in line
TODO: distribute by random and weight or set repeats
TODO: Auto fill path
TODO: Have an object be inserted as an object with option to deform mesh
TODO: Flip option to help radomize
TODO: Noise and scale per instance.
TODO: In clone complex, spline and surface need ability to insert another object, so going to need
to run through and build object list to get count setc for length and for any random or special rules
TODO: Create layer icons in inspector 
TODO: mesh from multiple cross sections, in two directions
TODO: Pivot change per loft
TODO: For mesh colliders could build from polys near the object
TODO: Get lofts building on threads, best if we can split a layer on a thread then get best performance
TODO: Add offset curves for this
TODO: If snapping curves pick knot to snap
TODO: Physuv option
TODO: x offset for uv by graph
TODO: Option to use path world space or local space
TODO: multiple cross sections
TODO: mesh deform, path deform but with cross sections as well
TODO: Cross alpha adjust on clone
TODO: Snap and clip on complex loft
TODO: Along with SplineNotify method need a SurfaceNotify so can tell clones etc a surface has changed
TODO: Scatter objects to surface (no combine of mesh just set transforms)
TODO: lerp value from calc up to rot value maybe
TODO: Rotation curves for section along loft, useful for corners
TODO: Option in shapes editor to align child curves
TODO: Option to flip capped ends
TODO: Option Snap curves to zero for multiple curves
TODO: texture atlas support?
TODO: mesh deform, path deform but with cross sections as well
TODO: Curve for vert spacing
TODO: Angle value 

DONE: Should support multiple cross sections?
DONE: Option to define start and length to do, easier for moving things along
DONE: Spacing between start and ends and mid objs
DONE: Clone to use path
DONE: Tell all other lofts about a layer update like spline to get correct realtime updates
DONE: Clone to use path
DONE: New Loft layer, scatter. 
DONE: Tell all other lofts about a layer update like spline to get correct realtime updates
DONE: Script to add to object to position on a spline or surface
DONE: Weights for random objects
DONE: Cap ends
DONE: multiple cross sections
DONE: On open curves dont wrap back to start and dont allow wrapping of value
DONE: Option to add curves to spline (add will duplicate current curve)
DONE: Add limits for start, length, cross etc to Loft object for sliders
DONE: Script to add to objects to position and orient them to a surface via alpha and calpha
DONE: say we have a wall loft say where we want that around another loft
DONE: Normal from layer we are applying to to govern up for new layer, ie wall will be perp to ground
